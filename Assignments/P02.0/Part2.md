## Generating Levels

Project overview [here](./README.md)


So, we need levels. Levels are created from maps and maps are created from tile sets (typically). So whats a tile set?



Whatever scheme you come up with to represent maps it doesn't matter as long as it works for you and you can load a map dynamically. This corresponds with item 3.  Why? Because I said so.... Ok, its the best because its the most robust, meaning it has the greatest ability to be very robust! Think about it. Replacing a map with a new tile-set and with proper planning, could render an entirely different scene! The tile-sets [here](https://craftpix.net/categorys/tilesets/) are not free (but I'm sure you can figure out how to clone them for educational purposes) and I'm sure you can see how this individual basically creates many differing worlds with nearly the same template. Look at his platformer templates and you will see the common threads.
