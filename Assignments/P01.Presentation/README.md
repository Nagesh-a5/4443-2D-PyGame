## Deliverables

- Show up for Zoom class on Thursday.
- Be ready to screen share and show your project.
- Have a "presentation" of your game ready. This means you have looked at the specifics above and have a plan on showing each of the aspects. It sounds silly since most of the specifics are highly coupled with others, but knowing what to present makes it go faster.
- Make sure you point out any additions you've added so we can be awed by your awesomeness.
- Bonus: Make a video of your presentation (before hand) and make it available to me somehow. I'm not sure how much extra credit it'll be worth, but it can't hurt.
