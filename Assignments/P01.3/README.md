## Project 1.3 - CovidZAR Sprite Animation
#### Due: 07-26-2020 (Sunday @ 12:30 p.m.)

## Overview of Part 3

This part of the assignment is to incorporate your own sprite animation and create an effect that is triggered when your player hits the wall (see last assignment). I don't care what the effect is, but it must have multiple frames that are shown in succession using the blit function.

Initially I was kind of expecting an animated sprite that indicated moving around the screen, but any animation that plays is ok. If it just plays over and over again without ever stopping. Than I will have to remove some points. The animation needs to be triggered by some event. The event can be moving, or clicking, or hitting a key. Just make sure you put in your instructions what needs to happen.

### Helper Code

- [All Files Here](../../Resources/RP01/P01.3/README.md)
- These files show you everything from playing a simple animation to moving a sprite around with animated movement.
- There are sprites in the media folder, but finding your own is preferred for max points.


### Requirements
- Display an animated sprite based on some event. 
- Your README will explain how to run your program.
- Specifically how to trigger your animated sprite.


## Deliverables

- Create a folder called `P01.3` in your `Assignments` folder.
- Add a file to your folder called `game_pt3.py` with the above code.
- Screen Shots
  - Provide at least one screen shot showing the animation.
  - If your animation is walking, then show one screen with standing still, and one while walking in some direction.
  - The difference between the two will show a change in your sprite.
- Add a `README.md` file to your `P01.3` folder with instructions on how to run your program guided by [R03](../../Resources/R03/README.md)


## Pseudo Rubric

- Does the program run?
- Does your animation run correctly (all the right frames, no glitches)?
- Did you find your own animation?
- Is your code commented? (Letter Grade)
